This repository will host the official implementation of the **RASALoRE** model, proposed in our paper titled:

> *"Region-Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings for Weakly Supervised Anomaly Detection in Brain MRI Scans."*

We are currently finalizing the codebase to ensure clarity, reproducibility, and ease of use. The code will be made publicly available **soon**.

Stay tuned for updates.
